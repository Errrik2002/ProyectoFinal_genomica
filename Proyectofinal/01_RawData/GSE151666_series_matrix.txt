!Series_summary	"Investigate the transcriptomic differences between HPV-positive and HPV-negative primary cervical tumors."
!Series_overall_design	"Whole transcriptome sequencing was performed on 68 pre-treatment, primary cervical cancer samples from cervical cancer patients treated at the Washington University School of Medicine. A minimum of 0.5Âµg of RNA with RIN > 7 was extracted for library preparation. Sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq 3000, 1x50nt, ~40 million reads per sample), and aligned to GRCh38 using STAR 2.7.0f."
!Series_type	"Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing"
